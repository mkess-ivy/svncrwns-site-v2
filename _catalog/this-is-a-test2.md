    image-caption-title: Started w/ wireframe + design mockups
    image-caption: At the beginning of new web projects, our process goes like this
      - we have a discovery session, we learn about the project, if it’s a good fit,
      we move forward.  We start designing the user experience using tools like Adobe
      Design, Marvel and Sketch.  Our favorite tool is Sketch.  We source stock photography
      to move quickly in our Agile process, and fill in the gaps as we get closer
      to a final design.  Once we finalize the design, we start developing the mockups
      into a live, clickable product that can be shared with a userbase.
