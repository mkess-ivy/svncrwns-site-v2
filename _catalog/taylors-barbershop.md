  summary: Taylor’s Barbershop is a franchised establishment based in Richmond, Virginia.  The
    founder of this barbershop has a legacy of cutting hair in his family, and founded
    the barbershop in 2009.  The founder expressed wanting to create a culture of
    diversity and luxury in the barbershop space.  We transformed that idea into the
    digital space.
  opportunity: 'This opportunity has been developing for some time.  Our team worked
    with the client on their first website that listed their services and pricing
    but didn’t allow for scheduling appointments or purchasing products.  After optimizing
    the business operations, it was time to bring some automation into the workflow
    by delivering a new website with e-commerce capabilities.  '
  insights: The team at Taylor’s Barbershop has been growing quickly.  We knew it
    would be important for our client to be able to update team, service and product
    information on the go.  With managing several schedules, there is a great opportunity
    to make sure customers are able to read reviews and make appointments easily.
  solution: This website was built on the Squarespace platform, allowing for easy
    management of products, shipping and payment tools.  We designed our website using
    Sketch, and then developed our custom pages using the e-commerce platform.

    image-caption: Using photography and messaging to create the tone and experience
      of a hair cut experience at this barbershop.  The images are black and white,
      and the brand colors are black, white, and brown.  This combination creates
      a clean, minimal design that allows the lifestyle of the barbershop imagery
      to make you feel connected.

    image-caption: 'This website has about 6 pages that are built using components.  The
      Squarespace platform is very simple and allows our client to run their store
      at a small-scale, confidently.   One of our client’s concerns was: will I be
      able to change the content with my team? Our team was able to create simple
      templates and an instruction manual to operate the website filled with screenshots
      and details.  '
