  summary: Taylor’s Barbershop is a franchised establishment based in Richmond, Virginia.  The
    founder of this barbershop has a legacy of cutting hair in his family, and founded
    the barbershop in 2009.  The founder expressed wanting to create a culture of
    diversity and luxury in the barbershop space.  We transformed that idea into the
    digital space.
  opportunity: 'This opportunity has been developing for some time.  Our team worked
    with the client on their first website that listed their services and pricing
    but didn’t allow for scheduling appointments or purchasing products.  After optimizing
    the business operations, it was time to bring some automation into the workflow
    by delivering a new website with e-commerce capabilities.  '
  insights: The team at Taylor’s Barbershop has been growing quickly.  We knew it
    would be important for our client to be able to update team, service and product
    information on the go.  With managing several schedules, there is a great opportunity
    to make sure customers are able to read reviews and make appointments easily.
  solution: This website was built on the Squarespace platform, allowing for easy
    management of products, shipping and payment tools.  We designed our website using
    Sketch, and then developed our custom pages using the e-commerce platform.

    image-caption-title: CREATING THE BARBERSHOP CULTURE THROUGH LIFESTYLE PHOTOGRAPHY
    image-caption: 'Photography, messaging, and iconography was used to develop the
      brand identity and feel of a hair cut experience at Taylors.  The imagery is
      black and white, and the brand colors are black, white, and brown.  This combination
      of images and colors creates a clean, timeless and minimal design that allows
      the lifestyle of the barbershop imagery to make you feel at home in the space.  '

    image-caption-title: SIMPLE LAYOUT , EASY MANAGEMENT
    image-caption: 'This website has about 6 pages that are built using a component
      system.  The Squarespace platform is very simple and allows our client to run
      their store at a small-scale, confidently.   One of our client’s concerns was:
      will I be able to change the content with my team? Our team was able to create
      simple templates and an instruction manual to operate the website filled with
      screenshots and details.   A simple layout with minimal design gives a brand
      the space to grow as it matures and begins to understand the details that it
      wants to incorporate into its identity.'

    image-caption-title: INCREASE SALES WITH APPOINTMENT SCHEDULING INTEGRATION
    image-caption: Adding appointment scheduling to this barbershop's platform has
      allowed them to increase their bookings online.  By having access to the Barbershop's
      appointment calendar & image gallery, a potential client can have a user experience
      that includes scheduling their grooming starting from the home page.  If you're

      saying.  The convenience of appointment notifications for your hair cut on Friday's
      @ 3pm are now seamless @ Taylor's Barbershop.
