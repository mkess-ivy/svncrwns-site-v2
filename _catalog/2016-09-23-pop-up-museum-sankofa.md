SVNCRWNS partnered with <a href="http://sankofaafricanbazaar.com" target="_blank">Sankofa African and World Bazaar</a> to create a Pop-Up Museum for Black History Month, entitled, SANKOFA.  The word Sankofa means “to go back and get it”.  With that in mind, we created a field trip to invite the youth of a few Baltimore City Public Schools to visit and experience our Pop-Up Museum to learn about black history and art prior to the teachings of American history. 

At SANKOFA, we were able to have a hands-on experience with authentic African art, instruments, an installation of clouds, story time, clothing, and more.
