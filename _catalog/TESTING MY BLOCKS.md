      information.  Having our platforms accessible on all devices with simple user
      experiences is always our main goal.  Don't lose sales because the user experience
      for mobile browsing is inadequate.

    image-caption-title: Started w/ wireframe + design mockups
    image-caption: At the beginning of new web projects, our process goes like this
      - we have a discovery session, we learn about the project, if itâ€™s a good fit,
      we move forward.  We start designing the user experience using tools like Adobe
      Design, Marvel and Sketch.  Our favorite tool is Sketch.  We source stock photography
      to move quickly in our Agile process, and fill in the gaps as we get closer
      to a final design.  Once we finalize the design, we start developing the mockups
      into a live, clickable product that can be shared with a userbase.
  - image-caption-title: Client delivered hi-res images for brand looks
    image-name: braneu-project-2.png
    image-caption: We cannot stress enough how important imagery is for launching
      and maintaining a fresh brand.  Our client delivered these images to be used
      on the website.  Usually we schedule and shoot images for our clients with website
      or e-commerce projects, however, this project had a tight timeline and the best
      option was for the client to deliver, and they did!
