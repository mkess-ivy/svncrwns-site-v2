<div class="catalog_video-text">
	Welcoming twenty-five of our closest friends one late evening in September, a full-course chef-prepared meal, courtesy of Chef Will (<a href="http://www.instagram.com/waternoxygen" target="_blank" rel="external" class="post-link">@waternoxygen</a>) with champagne filled glasses and a dimly lit, intimate space with lots of love and sounds.  Seated with those most likely to engage harmoniously, the essence of a sensory experience.  Guised as an intimate birthday party for Chavon (<a href="http://www.instagram.com/freebirdbella" target="_blank" rel="external" class="post-link">@freebirdbella</a>) turned beautiful dinner party with lots of good energy and exchange, it was a celebration!  Get into the visual.
