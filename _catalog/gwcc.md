summary: Greenmount West Community Center is a neighborhood institution in the Greenmount
  West neighborhood of Baltimore City.  Starting in 2016, the founders of the space
  saw an opportunity to bring programming, snacks, materials and equipment to service
  the youth 5 - 18 years of age in the neighborhood during evening, weekend and summer
  hours.
opportunity: This opportunity was connected to a bigger partnership with Mark Bradford
  and the Baltimore Museum of Art as he prepared for his exhibit opening of Tomorrow’s
  Another Day in September 2018.  As part of the rollout, Mr. Bradford created a partnership
  with local community initiatives to sponsor equipment and resources to promote sustainability.  To
  highlight this work in the center, we began outlining the GWCC story for the new
  website.
insights: Starting on the ground floor, we were able to pitch in with creating the
  brand identity, story and tone for how the center would communicate going forward.  We
  saw opportunities to share past wins, share the schedule of updates with community
  members, and be a hub of information and access in one of Baltimore’s newly renovated
  residential spaces.
solution: This website was built on the Jekyll framework which gave us a great amount
  of flexibility to incorporate the functionality for this site.

To build out the best site that matches the energy in the center, we knew we would need lots of images of the kids and instructors to guide our decision making with bringing the brand's story to life." %}

{% include components/editorial-image.html image-name="gwcc-project-2.png" image-caption-title="Win before the fold!" image-caption="Part of our design direction was to use fullscreen video throughout the site wherever possible.  For the home page, we decided to use a few snippets of video and add a gradient overlay to match the rest of the website.  Most importantly, as soon as you come to the homepage there is motion, there is life.  This encourages users to continue to explore the platform and learn even more from what this institution is bringing to its community." %}

{% include components/editorial-image.html image-name="gwcc-project-3.png" image-caption-title="Exercising the Overlay" image-caption="The overlay is one of our favorite playgrounds for custom websites.  Usually a menu is shown on the overlay and a hamburger menu is selected to access this area.  Due to the number of programming options at the center, we tried to find a nice, compact way of sharing this information immediately with nice visuals.  Our biggest concern was displaying too much text which would possibly discourage users from continuing their exploration.  In the overlay, the users are able to scroll the list of over 20+ programming options." %}
