  summary: "Noisy Tenants is a social agency that works with youth to create microbusinesses teaching entrepreneurship and business acumen skills."
  opportunity: "SVNCRWNS had the opportunity of working with this agency to help them with strategy to create their brand identity, identify their audience, develop their website with custom functionality and partner with them on several projects that positively impacted youth throughout Baltimore, MD."
  insights: "Since we've been working with the brand, we have observed the unique opportunities they have created &mdash; taking theater into classrooms, and on stage, to working with youth to create microbusinesses.  We knew their identity + their website would need to rely heavily on storytelling.  We knew early - sharing this portfolio of work, had to be dynamic and able to reach various audiences."
  solution: "A completely custom website with CMS powers.  We created a dynamic website built on the Jekyll framework.  Simple menus, lots of fullscreen video, a custom Bus Stop Tracker + more features that tell the story for this brand."

    image-caption-title: Bus Stop Buddies
    image-caption: Bus Stop Buddies is one of the many initiatives from the Noisy Tenants team.  After learning about the transportation issues in the community, we were able to design a Bus Stop Tracker that records the status of the timeliness daily.  This info can be easily shared with MTA and BCPS.  Custom functionality using Javascript and the Twitter API.
