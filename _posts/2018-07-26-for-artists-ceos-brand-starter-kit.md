First things first, when starting with a product, service or skill — your brand needs to be defined.  It needs to be easily digestible by a 5-year old and an 80-year old respectively.   After developing your brand identity and voice, you have something to talk about when you have an opportunity to meet with prospective customers.

Most times when you are first starting, customers don’t usually convert to paying customers during first contact.  Meeting a new brand, getting to know their services and validity is a bit of a courting process.  Customers like to find out who else has worked with you, understand important details and learn of the value your brand can provide to their life.

The best and most efficient way to communicate the necessary information to your new audience is by investing in several marketing tools.

Our brand starter kit offers production of three critical marketing tools.  To first-time artists + CEOs, your customers may like to be communicated with differently.  We have designed a process that communicates the most important message of your brand in several formats.  Remember in grade school, when the teacher first introduced this idea of how students best receive information.  Some of us are audible learners, some are visual learners, and some need to interact to gain a hands-on experience.  

Having a website can communicate testimonials from past customers, provide product details and methods to contact and support the business owner.  Videos are the most important piece of media today.  They are easy to digest, don’t require as much time as reading an article or product description on a website, and are informative in helping the customers create a relationship based on their understanding of the brand’s mission expressed visually.  The last piece of this equation are photos.  Photos can be shared by means of a lookbook, slideshow, or photography shared on your website giving the brand a unique look and feel.  

As part of our Summer Packages, we are promoting our Brand Starter Kit to consist of a general website, blog or e-commerce platform, a 1-minute visual to communicate product/service details or information about the business owners, and a 2-hour editorial photoshoot to provide clean photography for your website or social media.  Packages start at $1500 and can be customized.  Check out more of our summer packages.  Also, refer to our portfolio to preview a website project, a visual project + photo lookbook to understand the quality of value we would like to provide to you.
