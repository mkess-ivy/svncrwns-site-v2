  text-block-summary: This was the first place we started.  We knew as a creative company, as problem solvers that looking at our website wasn’t very informative, there wasn’t a story.  There was cool work, but how did these things tie together to make up a company?  How does the company work?  How can I work with this company?   These were questions that we were getting from our peers.  It was too abstract.  So we added some color and images, and more transparency.
