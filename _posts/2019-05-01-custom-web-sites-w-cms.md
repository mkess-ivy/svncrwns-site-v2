My favorite pieces of art are photo-journalism pieces.  I wish there was more photography on display at more contemporary art spaces.

I see paintings like these all the time.  Initially, I didn't quite get how solid colors on canvas were considered art, but as I've gotten more educated in the art space,  I do understand that this expands on the genres of art culture and criticism.

Artist statements are considered art too!  This statement resonated so deeply, also watched the Matrix Trilogy right after visiting this exhibit
