We were invited to talk at Creative Mornings in Baltimore, MD about the theme of "Context".  We touched on our recent trip to Los Angeles to visit abstract artist, Mark Bradford, and talked about what our work means to us and what inspires us to continue to focus on building and expanding on community resources.
