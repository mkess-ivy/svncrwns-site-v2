The Home Page
-----------------------------------------
This was the first place we started.  We knew as a creative company, as problem solvers that looking at our website wasn’t very informative, there wasn’t a story.  There was cool work, but how did these things tie together to make up a company?  How does the company work?  How can I work with this company?   These were questions that we were getting from our peers.  It was too abstract.  So we added some color and images, and more transparency.

Another important point, we removed “strategy + production” and updated it to “We’re a production space”.  That’s still a working title, but the most important idea here is that we’re streamlining things and we’re making our brand easier to understand, easier to digest.  We took the “Featured Projects” section, and added images.  Seems like a small detail, but imagery gave our projects more life, and to the end user, they’re more likely to view our work, see our skills and be interested in supporting more of what we’re doing in the future.

We added a quick link “View our Portfolio” that links to the “Work” page because that’s the most important page for this platform.   Beside the quick link, we added a sign up form for our newsletter, so our users know we’re interested in talking to them more.  We want to start building an audience around our work, so this feature is also very important to our company’s goals.

The Overlay
-----------------------------------------

Our initial overlay wasn’t very informative.  At the very top was the main menu for the website, and after that section - there is the complete list of our work portfolio for our production company.  Unless our new users, who know nothing about our company, had about 3 hours to spend browsing our films, photoshoots and websites, they would’nt be able to learn much., which resulted in really high bounce rates based on our site analytics.

*The New Overlay menu*

We removed the main menu and made it a fixed menu to be visible anywhere on the site.  We organized our portfolio work into two categories, client work and in-house projects.  We added tags to our work so users can have an idea of what kind of work they are about to view.  The overlay menu is visible on all pages, positioned in the lower right hand corner.  We also made the overlay button animated. Before, there were two images, that never really lined up as perfectly as we wanted.  The animations and organization here, should drastically improve our bounce rates.

The Work Page
-----------------------------------------

Welcome to the Work page.  We added this page to highlight all work that has been completed this year, 2018.  Seeing the activity our company has on this page, along with category tags such as photo and film, and work-space tags that let you know if the project is client or in-house - this information really shares an aerial view of how we’ve evolved in this third year of business.  Many people choose their companies, our company chose us.  During interesting times, it was birthed.  Our very first production, which is in post-production, is a documentary feature that was inspired due to real events happening in our home city, Baltimore, during the April 2015 Uprising in lieu of the death of Freddie Gray and the all-time high rate of police violence against black citizens.

After completing the initial production, to setup our story and interview our contributors, we took action in our city, looking for opportunities to help businesses using a skillset that’s both creative and driven by results.  Through lots of trial and error over the last two years, we’ve learned how to be valuable assets to businesses that were interested in growing and tackling unseen opportunities.  As we go into this next year, with a more refined approach, we’re turning our skills inward and will be focusing more on our in-house projects to move our company forward.  We have lots of ideas for unseen opportunities that we can tackle for ourselves.  We have projects in post-production that we’re finalizing, and we are learning how to use our business skills to launch and grow brands under our own domain.

The Journal Page
-----------------------------------------

The Journal page is where we share ideas, we share things we make in the studio and we evoke conversations based on our insights.  Because of our experience, we have lots of information to share about branding, about producing content, and using your  identity as a company to grow and reach new markets.

The Contact Page
-----------------------------------------

Before, we just had an email address, now we have more context here, plus contact information.  All of pages are following a design system.  We’re making all the pieces more cohesive, through and through the entire brand.
