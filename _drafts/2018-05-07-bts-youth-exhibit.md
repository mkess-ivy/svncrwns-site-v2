featured_summary: "Our team partnered with Greenmount West Community Center to assist with developing programming for the community.  In that time, we created a curriculum for youth photography club, taught the youth photography skills and created an exhibit to display and sell the photography."

One of our favorite highlights was making sure each photographer was featured in the exhibit and taking headshots and framing them for everyone to see.  The excitement of seeing the youth photographers see themselves on the walls as artists was amazing!

Thank you to Gallery CA, a gallery space inside City Arts in the Greenmount West Community.  Thank you for sponsoring space and helping us to give the community a platform to display and sell their art.  This was a life-changing experience for everyone involved.

Even our nephews came to visit!  It's definitely a joy having a company that focuses on the art space.  We get to include them on all of our projects.

Sitting in the print shop of Kinya Kiongozi, based in Baltimore, MD, working with the printer to make sure we have everything displayed correctly in our youth exhibit.  Kinya was super helpful in laying out our exhibit and maximizing the number of photos printed so that we were able to share with the community.
