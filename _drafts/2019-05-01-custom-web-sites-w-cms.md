My favorite pieces of art are photo-journalism pieces.  I wish there was more photography on display at more contemporary art spaces.

I see paintings like these all the time.  Initially, I didn't quite get how solid colors on canvas were considered art, but as I've gotten more educated in the art space,  I do understand that this expands on the genres of art culture and criticism.
